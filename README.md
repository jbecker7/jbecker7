### Hi! My name is Jonathan.

I'm a rising Senior at Claremont McKenna College pursuing a dual major in International Relations and Chinese, along with a Sequence in Computer Science.

This summer, I am interning at [Chorus Sleep (YC '21)](https://www.chorussleep.com/) doing full-stack development with React, Dart, and Go.

I'm interested in any and all projects that will allow me to become a better developer! Feel free to reach out if you have a project that I can help with.

You can see my portfolio website [here](http://jbecker.me) and my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-becker-593069238/).
