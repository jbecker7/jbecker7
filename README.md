### Hi! My name is Jonathan.

I graduated in December 2023 from Claremont
            McKenna College with a dual degree in International Relations and
            Chinese, along with a sequence in Computer Science. This spring I
            will be attending the NYU Bridge Program to sharpen my skills, after
            which I plan to go on to a CS Master's Program in the fall to
            solidify my CS education.


This past summer, I interned at [Chorus Sleep (YC '21)](https://www.chorussleep.com/) doing full-stack development with Flutter/Dart, Go, and TypeScript/React.

I'm interested in any and all projects that will allow me to become a better developer! Feel free to reach out if you have a project that I can help with.

You can see my portfolio website [here](http://jbecker.me) and my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-becker-593069238/).
