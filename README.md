### Hi! My name is Jonathan.

I'm a Junior at Claremont McKenna College pursuing a dual major in International Relations and Chinese, along with a Sequence in Computer Science.

I'm currently looking for internships for next summer that will allow me to develop my programming skills and see what an SDE job is really like.

I'm interested in any and all projects that will allow me to become a better developer! Feel free to reach out if you have a project that I can help with.

You can see my portfolio website [here](http://jbecker.me) and my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-becker-593069238/).
